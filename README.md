## This repository have the implementation of the following searching algorithms in Java:

- ### Linear Search (often used)
- ### Binary Search (often used)
- ### Interpolation Search (sometimes used)
- ### Jump Search (rarely used - Binary Search better)
- ### Ternary Search (rarely used - Binary Search better)
- ### Exponential Search (rarely used - Binary Search better)

#### Only in Linear Search array doesn't need to be sorted
